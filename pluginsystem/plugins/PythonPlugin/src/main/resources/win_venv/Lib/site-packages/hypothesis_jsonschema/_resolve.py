"""
Canonicalisation logic for JSON schemas.

The canonical format that we transform to is not intended for human consumption.
Instead, it prioritises locality of reasoning - for example, we convert oneOf
arrays into an anyOf of allOf (each sub-schema being the original plus not anyOf
the rest).  Resolving references and merging subschemas is also really helpful.

All this effort is justified by the huge performance improvements that we get
when converting to Hypothesis strategies.  To the extent possible there is only
one way to generate any given value... but much more importantly, we can do
most things by construction instead of by filtering.  That's the difference
between "I'd like it to be faster" and "doesn't finish at all".
